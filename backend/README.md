# Backend - CatDiary API

This is the backend service for **CatDiary**, built using Flask and OpenAI's GPT-4o + TTS API.

It receives cat photos, analyzes the image, generates a diary entry based on the cat's detected tone, and returns both text and generated audio.

---

## How It Works

1. Receive an image via POST request.
2. Use GPT-4o (with vision) to analyze the cat's expression.
3. Detect a matching emotional tone (e.g. sarcastic, dramatic).
4. Generate a role/persona and diary-style monologue.
5. Use OpenAI TTS (Text-to-Speech) to turn the diary into a voice message.
6. Return all the information as JSON + serve the audio file.
